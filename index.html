        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Marilyn Monroe, born Norma Jeane Mortenson, is arguably one of the most popular icons of all time.
          A popular movie star who was born in 1926, she still resonates with people today.  She has appeared in
        over 30 films, made several television appearances and had been the topic of gossip regarding her
      personal life throughout her career.  She passed away in 1962 and while her death was officially ruled
    a suicide, several conspiracies remain that contradict that.   </p>
